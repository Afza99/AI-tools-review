🔹 Overview
This file contains a basic Calculator module written in Python, which supports common arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes utility functions like doubling a number and a placeholder "dummy" function.

🔧 Functions and Descriptions
🔹 add(a, b)
Returns: the sum of a and b
Example: add(3, 4) → 7

🔹 subtract(a, b)
Returns: the result of a - b
Example: subtract(10, 4) → 6

🔹 multiply(a, b)
Returns: the result of a * b
Example: multiply(3, 5) → 15

🔹 divide(a, b)
Returns: the result of a / b
Warning: No error handling for division by zero
Example: divide(10, 2) → 5.0
➡️ Should add check: if b == 0

🔹 double(a)
Returns: double the input value
Example: double(6) → 12

🔹 dummy()
Prints: "This function does nothing"
Purpose: Placeholder for testing or demonstration

🛠️ Suggested Improvements
Add error handling in divide() to avoid ZeroDivisionError

Rename dummy() to something more descriptive

Write unit tests for each function using unittest or pytest
